### Goals

Provide a managed port of GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/D3D12MemoryAllocator

The library is  blittable, trim safe, AOT compatible, and as close to 1-to-1 with the underlying C API definitions as feasible. The general setup is fully compatible with the native definitions and could even be used against native exports that produce the relevant allocation objects if that were desired; however, since all the code is present this is primarily a port of the logic and doesn't rely on the original native library existing.
